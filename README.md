### Hi there 👋, I'm Isaac!

I'm a **Business Analyst** with 2.5 years of experience in market research and business process diagnostics. I've complemented this qualitative experience with deep technical skills in quantitative analysis.

I am a professional focused on problem-solving, acting as a bridge between technical and business teams. I enjoy translating complex business challenges into data analysis and communicating the results clearly.

My projects in predictive modeling, risk analysis, and operations optimization demonstrate how I apply these skills in practice.
